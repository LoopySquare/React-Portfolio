# React Portfolio
## Description
### My portfolio update built with React. There are several style changes I still wish to implement, but calling it good enough for now. I had some issues deploying to gh-pages and am still running into an issue where an opacity of 1% is being applied to some of my elements on deployment. So far, I have been unsuccessful in resolving the problem.
